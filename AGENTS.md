# Project Agents.md Guide for OpenAI Codex

This Agents.md file provides comprehensive guidance for OpenAI Codex and other AI agents working with this codebase.
This version was adapted from one found on https://github.com/fatfreecrm/fat_free_crm/

## Project Structure

This project follows a standard Ruby on Rails application structure

- `/app`: Source code that OpenAI Codex should analyze
  - `/assets`: CSS and Javascript components
  - `/controllers`: Controllers
  - `/views`: Views written in ERB
  - `/models`: ActiveRecord models 
- `/public`: Static assets (OpenAI Codex should not modify these directly)
- `/test`: Test files that OpenAI Codex should maintain and extend

## Installation

- Install a version of ruby as per .ruby-version
- Run `bin/setup` to ensure all relevant dependencies are installed
- Run `bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test` to validate the database configuration is correct.
- Run `bin/rails db:setup test` to validate test

## Coding Conventions

### General Conventions for Agents.md Implementation

- OpenAI Codex should follow the existing code style in each file
- Agents.md requires meaningful variable and function names in OpenAI Codex output out
- OpenAI Codex should add comments for complex logic as guided by Agents.md

### CSS/Styling Standards for OpenAI Codex

- OpenAI Codex should use CSS for styling as documented in Agents.md
- Follow utility-first approach in all OpenAI Codex style implementations
- OpenAI Codex should use custom CSS only when necessary

## Testing Requirements

OpenAI Codex should run tests with the following commands:

```bash
# Run all tests with OpenAI Codex
bin/rails test

# Run specific test file with OpenAI Codex
bin/rails test/system/sending_messages_test.rb
```

## Pull Request Guidelines for OpenAI Codex

When OpenAI Codex helps create a PR, please ensure it:

1. Includes a clear description of the changes as guided by Agents.md

3. Ensures all tests pass for code generated by OpenAI Codex
4. Includes screenshots for UI changes implemented with OpenAI Codex
5. Keeps PRs focused on a single concern as specified in Agents.md

## Programmatic Checks for OpenAI Codex
